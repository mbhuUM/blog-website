Welcome, I'm Mike. I attended the University of Michigan from 2020 to 2024 and graudated with a degree in CS and a minor in math. I am particularly interested in information security, software engineering, and game development.

I made this page to keep a log of certain thoughts as well as for any write ups I want to do in the future.
